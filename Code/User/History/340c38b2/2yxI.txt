simple var declaration

var types:
i32
i64
f32
f64
char
string
boolean
void
struct

char delimited by single quotes
string delimited by double

array declaration {
    known elements:
        let arr: [i32, 5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    unknown elements:
        let unknown: [i32, 5] = {}; // this will tell the compiler that you have an empty array of 5 32 bit signed ints but dont yet know their values
    
    to set a value, use a for loop
}

let x: i32 = 10; // NOTE, VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: type annotation MUST BE present

let x = 10 // this is bad and will throw an error when i get to parsing because no type

let float: f64 = 3.1415926

let name: string = "Hello"
let hello: char = 'H'

let array: [boolean, 2] = {true, false};
let new: [char, 10] = {'A', 'l', 'a', 'n'};

function declaration {
    follows this structure:

    implementation:

        }

        fn add(a: i32, b: i64) -> i64 {     // This is bad because you cant convert from 32 bit to 64
            return a + b;
        }

        // when adding two numbers the numbers must of the same type
}

    implementation:
        struct Node<T> { // T is generic type, can be replaced with anything
            let value: T;
            let next: &Node<T>? // lets the compiler know that next is a optional reference to node meaning it can be null or have a value
        }
